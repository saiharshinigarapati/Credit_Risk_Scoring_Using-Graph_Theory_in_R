# Credit Risk Scoring Using-Graph_Theory in R


## Project Overview


This project demonstrates the implementation of a graph-based deep learning model using the Deep Graph Library (DGL) and PyTorch. Additionally, an AutoML baseline model is trained to evaluate the performance of the graph neural network (GNN) against tabular data. This project is specifically structured to perform node classification on a graph structure and predict binary outcomes (investment grade vs. below investment grade) for companies based on both tabular and graph-based features.
